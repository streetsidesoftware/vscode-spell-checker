Settings, Configuration, and Preferences

## `cSpell.configLocation`

A resource level setting that specifies the location of the `cspell.json` file.

## `cSpell.userWordsUrl`, `cSpell.wordsUrl`, `cSpell.ignoreWordsUrl`

## Raw Notes

-   need setting to indicate that settings should use `cspell.json` by default.
-   need to be able to specify the location of user words, words, ignore words, and forbid words.
-   would like to have a format for a single list of words that represents words / ignore / forbid.
    -   Use the format for cspell 5
        -   `!` indicates forbidden
        -   `+` indicates compound required
        -   `*` indicates optional compound
        -   ` ` (don't know yet) indicates do not suggest.
