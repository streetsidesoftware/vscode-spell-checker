-   [ ] [Support Workspace Trust 路 Issue #839 路 streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/issues/839)

    Workspace Trust is going to require some modifications to `cspell` in order to prevent it from
    loading any untrusted sources.

    There is a two step plan:

    1. Disable the extension in an untrusted environment.
    2. Enable the extension and use `cspell` trust settings to prevent loading of untrusted `.js` files.
